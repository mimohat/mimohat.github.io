                <p>I am a tutoring teacher from China and have zero experience apart from what I have learned in IIT
                    including the MVC model of web app backend development which mainly copes with data bases. </p>
                <p>Greatly interested in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lately, I hope to make this course a start
                    for
                    my TCM-related article-sharing program.</p>

                    Professor Debarlaben is teaching us ITMD 541 Web Application Foundations. The course will cover
                    fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A
                    focus will be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with
                    HTML and CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with other services.
