            <h2 class="subtitle">Hi, this is Michu WU!</h2>
            <p>I am a tutoring teacher from China and have zero experience apart from what I have learned in IIT
                including the MVC model of web app backend development which mainly copes with data bases. </p>
            <p>Greatly interested in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lately, I hope to make this course a start
                for
                my TCM-related article-sharing program.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">This web app serves as an assignment from Professor Debarlaben F. Anita.</h2>
            <p>Professor Debarlaben is teaching us ITMD 541 Web Application Foundations. The course will cover
                fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus
                will
                be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with HTML
                and
                CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with other services.</p>
            <div>

                <p>So much fun with CSS that I have made something more than requirements in Lab 1.</p>
